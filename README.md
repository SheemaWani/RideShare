🚗 RideShare – Carpooling Web Application

RideShare is a full-stack carpooling web application designed to make travel safe, affordable, and eco-friendly. Along with standard features such as publishing rides, booking seats, managing profiles, and connecting with verified travelers, RideShare introduces female-only ride options, allowing women to travel with trusted female drivers for enhanced safety and comfort.

To further strengthen security, the platform includes a Challan Verification System, where users can instantly check a vehicle’s challan or traffic violation history before booking. This ensures transparency and helps riders make informed decisions.

RideShare also features email verification during signup and real-time OTP authentication for critical actions, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring secure user interactions. Together, these intelligent safety layers create a trusted environment that encourages responsible commuting and empowers women to travel confidently.
